  I wrote a quick Python script to help construct all of the examples in
  <a href="{{ abs_url('blog/2015/01/04/hymmnos-quatrasphere/') }}">
    my Quatrasphere post</a>.  After cleaning it up a bit, I posted it
  to <a href="https://github.com/darkfeline/binasphere">Github</a> in case
  anyone would ever need to play with some Hymmnos.  The rest of the text
  processing in my post was done with Vim macros, which I won't bother posting
  since the macros were done rather haphazardly.

  Note that the tool itself is a little overkill, as clever use of UNIX standard
  utilities can do the same thing (for example,
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(Unix)">
  join</a>), but digging through manpages is no fun.
