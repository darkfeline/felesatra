title: How to make a FOSS project
template: content_page.html
---

<section>
  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
    This guide outlines how a FOSS project should be made.  I am writing this
    because making a FOSS project is not obvious, especially for programmers who are
    by nature not well-versed in paperwork, management, and things of such nature.
    I have had some experience creating and maintaining FOSS projects, and I have
    had the luxury of reading a well-written book on the subject (unfortunately, I
    have forgotten its name and can no longer find it).  However, that book was a
    veritable tome, and very few people enjoy reading such a long technical text,
    hence this guide.
  </p>

  <p>
    The aim of this guide is to lay out the fundamental parts of a good FOSS project
    as concisely as possible, to stem the growing tide of poor FOSS projects.
  </p>

  <p>
    This first part describes a FOSS project abstractly, while a forthcoming second
    part describes the available tools and services for making a FOSS project in
    practice, and future parts may cover certain topics in detail (documentation,
    for example).

  <h1>Crazy axe murderer principle</h1>

  <p>
    The guiding principle behind all of this is that somewhere out there is a fellow
    programmer cum crazy axe murderer.  You do not want him to become frustrated with
    your FOSS project because he will come to hunt you down, and you better be able
    to convince him that he's the one in the wrong, not you.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your project lacks a homepage and thus Crazy Axe Murderer cannot find the
    documentation, you're screwed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Crazy Axe Murderer wants to file a bug report and he cannot find out how to
    do so, you're screwed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your project lacks proper documentation, you're screwed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If Crazy Axe Murderer wants to contact you to shout at you about all of the
    above, but he cannot even find a single email address to use, you're a special
    kind of screwed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you follow this principle, you should be in good shape.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>The homepage</h1>

  <p>
    Your project must have a homepage.  The homepage serves as the heart of your
    project.  Every other part of your project links to the homepage and can be
    found on the homepage.  When a user or developer finds your homepage, they will
    have easy access to every single part of your project: the code, release news,
    contact information, contribution guidelines, documentation, everything.
  </p>

  <p>
    The homepage does not have to be pretty, it just needs to make all the necessary
    information available as easily as possible.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>The documentation</h1>

  <p>
    Your project needs documentation, and I mean this seriously, not in a "yeah we
    know, but we're developers, who actually writes documentation?" sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your documentation should cover the following:
  </p>

  <ul>

    <li>Installation and dependencies, including dependency versions.  If a user is
      running into a bug because he used libfoo 1.2 instead of 1.1, that's your
      fault for not explicitly stating that.</li>
    <li>Usage guide.  This should give the user enough information for him to fill in
      the gaps using your comprehensive command and API reference documentation.</li>
    <li>Command and API reference that documents all commands, protocols, APIs,
      file formats, and/or database formats of your software.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are two extremes you are aiming to avoid (excluding the degenerate case
    where you don't have any documentation at all):
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>You have a usage guide but no comprehensive API reference.  The user can get
      started very quickly, but just as quickly hits a brick wall where the
      features he wants to use are only partially documented or not documented at
      all.  This case seems to be the most common.</li>
    <li>You have a comprehensive API reference but no accessible usage guide.  While
      all the information is there, a new user has no idea where to start looking.</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h1>The code</h1>

  <p>
    It goes without saying that as a FOSS project you need code.  Developers speak
    code, so the code itself is generally not a big problem.  However, developers do
    not generally speak law or management, and there are a few critical points here.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h1>The license</h1>

    <p>
      First, you need to pick a FOSS license to use and properly apply to your code.
      Common choices are the GPL, Apache, and MIT licenses, although I suggest the GPL
      or Apache licenses, which have the legal support of the Free Software
      Foundation (FSF).
    </p>

    <p>
      You need to include a copy of the entire license with your source code and add a
      header to the top of every single source file covered by the license.
    </p>

    <p>
      The FSF's website contains <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing">
      detailed information about licensing</a>, which is backed by legal
      counsel.  You should go read it.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you do not include a license or apply it properly, your code will receive the
      default legal protection of "All Rights Reserved", i.e. your code will be
      proprietary software.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Version control</h1>

    <p>
    You need to use a distributed version control system.  A version control system
    is mandatory, and for a FOSS project it really needs to be distributed, like Git
    or Mercurial.
    </p>

    <p>
    A public repository of your code should be accessible from the homepage.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>The source distribution</h1>

    <p>
    Your project's source code repository should be what I shall call "source
    distribution ready".  That is to say, a clone or snapshot of your source code
    should be ready for distribution as a finished software product.
    </p>

    <p>
    It should include everything necessary to build the software, including scripts
    and files used for the build process, the documentation, a README, a change log,
    and the source code license at a minimum.
    </p>

    <p>
    Someone should be able to put this source distribution on a USB drive (along
    with the source distributions of any necessary dependencies), take it into an
    isolated room without Internet, and compile, install, and use your software.
    </p>

    <p>
    Ideally, you should provide actual source distributions (in archive format, like
    .tar.gz) for your releases, but using your source code repository as your source
    distribution is acceptable.
    </p>

    <p>
    (Note that you shouldn't be including external dependencies in your source
    distribution.  Those external dependencies, if they are also FOSS, should have
    their own source distributions.)
    </p>

  <h1>Project management</h1>

  <p>
  This section covers boring management stuff that is nevertheless important to
  the running of the project.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h1>Project communication</h1>

    <p>
    You need clear communcation channels for development and support for your
    project.  For a small project, this can be as simple as posting your email on
    the homepage, and for a large project, this can be as complex as an integrated
    forum, IRC, and mailing list solution.
    </p>

    <p>
    You need communcation channels for your project.  They must be easily accessible
    and usable.  The maintainers and developers for the project must use them, which
    is to say that development communication should be public.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Bug reporting</h1>

    <p>
    You need to have a bug tracker.  This allows users and developers to track bugs.
    This might sound stupidly pedantic, but there are a lot of FOSS projects that
    lack this.  You need this.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Contribution guidelines</h1>

    <p>
    There are two parts to contribution guidelines.  One is providing guidelines for
    how bug reports should look like, how patches should look like, how code should
    look like, how commits are made, and so on.  This will keep the project
    consistent and running smoothly in the long run.
    </p>

    <p>
    The other part is the legal rights and licensing guidelines.  You need to spell
    these out so you don't run into trouble later on.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here's a quick introduction (disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer):
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>The person who writes the code owns the copyright over that code.  Copyright
      is ultimate power.</li>
    <li>Licenses are given by the copyright holder to other people so that they can
      use the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    If a contributor uses a FOSS license for their code, the project may be able to
    use that code, depending on license compatibility.  However the project cannot
    change that license in the future unless the contributor also hands over his
    copyright to the project (or the license explicitly states so).
    </p>

    <p>
    This is a serious issue, and this is the reason why the Linux kernel is stuck on
    the inferior GPLv2 instead of the superior GPLv3: the kernel project never got
    the copyrights from the original contributors of all of its code, so it cannot
    change the license of that code.
    </p>

    <p>
    GPLv3 solves this problem somewhat by explicitly allowing a license upgrade to
    future versions of the GPL even if you do not own copyright.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is messy legal territory, so I'll only give one piece of non-expert legal
    advice:
    </p>

    <p>
    The project should be licensed under GPLv3 (it's important to use version 3 of
    the license for the reason stated above).  Contributors keep their copyright
    over code they have written, but they license it under GPLv3, giving the project
    full legal rights to use that code and allowing for upgrades to future versions
    of the GPL.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h1>Project governance</h1>

    <p>
    If/when your project grows large enough, you will need to seriously consider
    setting up the formal governance of the project: who owns what parts of the
    project, who has which rights and powers, how power should be granted or taken
    away, and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
    This is far outside the scope of the majority of projects, so I won't go into
    further detail.
    </p>
