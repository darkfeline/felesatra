One of the main difficulties of using Linux is finding the right software.
Often, FOSS offers multiple choices of software for any one task, the trick is
finding the right one.
</p>

<p>
  For painting, <a href="https://krita.org/">Krita</a> has been an old and
  faithful standby for many Linux users.  As an amateur and unskilled artist, I
  cannot say much about it other than that I have found it sufficient.
</p>

<p>
  However, there is another option: <a href="http://mypaint.intilinux.com/">MyPaint</a>,
which is free software and also available on Windows.  From my brief experiment
with it, I have found its user interface to be more accessible than Krita's, its
default set of brushes more than satisfy my personal art hobbies, and it works
with my graphics tablet out of the box.

<p>
Your results may vary, but it's definitely worth checking out along with Krita
if you are painting on Linux.
