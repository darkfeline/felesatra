title: Why holy wars matter

What are holy wars?  Even if you aren't familiar with the term, you are
probably acquainted with the concept: Coke vs Pepsi, Xbox vs Playstation, Emacs
vs vi, Windows vs Mac, Linux vs BSD, MIT vs GPL.  These are wars waged with few
facts and many personal invectives, in an attempt to assert moral or technical
superiority.  Anyone with a lot of experience with holy wars learn to steer
clear, for nothing good ever comes out of it.  Or does it?

<p>
I believe that, even if holy wars may be harmful and ultimately futile, that
there's a real reason for fighting (and hopefully, winning) holy wars, similar
to the reason why real religious wars are fought: community size.
</p>

Imagine the following scenario: there are two competing open source programs, A
and B.  For realism, feel free to fill in the spots with Emacs or Vim, in
whichever order you like.  A "wins" the holy war, gaining most, if not all, of
the community in the domain of users of A and B.  A gains many well-written
up-to-date guides and tutorials, while B only has a few, out-of-date guides.
A's set of features grows far beyond B and remains just as stable, with many
talented developers contributing code while the watchful masses of users
reports any bugs.  Other programs only support A because so many people use A
and very few people use B.  Any advantage that B may have is quickly
appropriated by A, by its many users; no such speed of adoption exists for B,
whose users would be lucky to get an extremely useful feature from A a year
later.  A has gained immensely, while B has lost immensely.  As a user of A, I
benefit from every other user of A. Holy wars matter because community size
matters.

However, this piece of writing is not meant to encourage readers to begin
hurling ad hominem attacks in the nearest forum or mailing list.  While it is
true that holy wars matter, to the extent of achieving a large community size,
there are usually better ways than those in which holy wars are traditionally
waged, that is, with personal attacks.  One catches more flies with honey than
with vinegar, as the saying goes.  Here, marketing (of the morally sound
variety) is the optimal weapon.  Encouraging users to switch to A, presenting
hard facts, and helping such new users during the difficult transition period,
while neither forcing nor attacking, and allowing for a clear escape route at
any time (for software, this amounts to using open data formats and support
for exporting and importing data) will lure in many to your cause.

Happy hunting.
