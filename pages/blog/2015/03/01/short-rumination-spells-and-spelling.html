<p>
Take the word "spell": to write or say the letters that form a word or part of
a word.  That is, to assemble meaning.  Usually, it means to assemble words of
meaning from letters that lack meaning, methodically.

"Spell": noun, words or a formula supposed to have magical powers.  Normally,
one would spell words, but "spell" at one point did mean "speech, discourse" in
English.  So one would indeed spell spells.  Spelling is the art of creating
words, and words have power.  One spells meaningful words from meaningless
letters, just as a fictional wizard may spell magical spells from meaningless
formulae, or a modern scientist may spell magical predictions from meaningless
points of data, or an engineer may spell a skyscraper that can stand in the
sky, from his formulas and figures, each of which lacks such power
individually.  I don't think that it is a coincidence that "spell" has come to
share both meanings.
