title: Transiting API Boundaries
---

<p>
  The <a href="https://blog.golang.org/context">context</a> package was
  added to Go in 2014.  It's generally agreed that context is kind of
  ugly and unwieldy, but it solves some practical problems.
</p>

<p>
  One of the problems that context solves is cancellation.  While the Go
  language makes concurrency easy with goroutines and channels, if you
  want to communicate with a goroutine to cancel it, before context, you
  would have had to implement it yourself.  It's not hard to do, but
  making sure that cancellation propagates properly is a chore.
</p>

<p>
  The other thing that context solves is transiting API boundaries.
  Arbitrary values can be attached to contexts, and at first glance this
  seems like a incomprehensible, horrible thing to do.  Why use this
  instead of passing in regular arguments to a function?
</p>

<p>
  Go's http package provides a classic example.  http.Handler is an
  interface containing the method:
</p>

<pre><code>ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)</code></pre>

<p>
  Anything that implements this method can be used to easily run an
  HTTP server.  Since Handler is an interface, it's easy to write
  middleware, wrappers that take a Handler and return a Handler, like the
  standard StripPrefix function.  You can write middleware that makes
  sure the user is logged in and checks whether the user has the right
  authorization to access a certain page.
</p>

<pre><code>http.ListenAndServe(":80", logInUser(checkIfAdmin(myHandler))</code></pre>

<p>
  But wait!  How do you pass the user credentials from the logInUser
  Handler to the checkIfAdmin Handler?  The signature of the ServeHTTP
  method cannot be changed.
</p>

<p>
  You could define your own private interface:
</p>

<pre><code>type myHandler interface {
	http.Handler
	checkCredentials(userCredentials) bool
}

func logInUser(h myHandler) Handler {...}
func checkIfAdmin(h Handler) myHandler {...}
</code></pre>

<p>
  But what if you want to add middleware between these two functions?
<p>

<pre><code>http.ListenAndServe(":80", logInUser(
	somepackage.CanonicalizePath(checkIfAdmin(myHandler))</code></pre>

<p>
  There's no way to make somepackage understand your custom
  interface!  This is what it means to transit API boundaries, where
  you have one API that goes "through" another API.
<p>

<pre>my API -> other API -> my API</pre>

<p>
  By using values attached to a context, you can pass arguments
  through the middle API.
</p>

<p>
  This is not a new problem or solution.  Richard Stallman discussed
  this exact problem in
  his <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html#SEC17">1981
    ACM paper</a> on Emacs, where he justifies using dynamic scoping
  in Emacs.  In fact, context values in Go are like dynamically scoped
  variables in a different shape (the "scope" is the context object
  which is determined at runtime for each call).
</p>

<p>
  Another example of transiting APIs in Go are wrapped error values.
  Go 1.13 introduced a standard way for wrapping and unwrapping
  errors.  This is primarily useful for making sure errors can safely
  transit different APIs.  Consider a retry helper function:
<p>

<pre><code>myFunction := func() error {...}
err := retry.Retry(myFunction)
if err == myErr {...}
</code></pre>

<p>
  If the retry package were to add context to any errors without a
  standard wrapping convention, it would
  irreversibly destroy any error that your myFunction API might
  return, but with Go 1.13's error wrapping, we can allow any custom
  error values to transit the retry package's API:
<p>

<pre><code>myFunction := func() error {...}
// This error value is coming from my API, going through the retry package,
// and then back to my API.
err := retry.Retry(myFunction)
if errors.Is(err, myErr) {...}
</code></pre>
