title: The Crucifixion of Richard Matthew Stallman
---

<blockquote>
  The job of scientists is to evaluate evidence and seek truth.  We have
  a social responsibility to do that as well.  I hope that we scientists
  will never evade our social responsibility to seek and defend the
  truth out of fear that the press will misconstrue our search.
</blockquote>

  If that resonated with you at all, I implore you to seek out the
  truth yourself.
