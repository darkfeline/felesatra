title: Emacs undo
---

<p>
  The ability to undo changes is relatively new.  Undo didn't exist
  before digital text editing, and it is now present in even the most
  basic text editing software along with cut, copy, and paste (which
  are conveniently bound to Ctrl-Z, X, C, V in most programs).
</p>

<p>
  The earliest programs to support undo only allowed the user to undo
  the last change, due to the limitations of computers at the time.
  You could undo a single change, and if you wanted to redo the
  change, you could undo again.
</p>

<p>
  As computers grew more powerful, multi-level undo emerged naturally.
  The most common way this is implemented is as a partial linear
  history.  After making some changes, you can undo those changes one
  at a time, and also redo them one at a time.  However, if you undo
  some changes and then make a new change, all of the changes you
  undid are thrown away and your new change is put at the top of the
  history.  This has the unfortunate side effect of making it possible
  to lose changes that you want to restore later, but it works well
  enough most of the time and it's easy to understand.
</p>

<p>
  Another way to implement multi-level undo is using a tree.  This is
  less common; one program that does this is Vim.  Like with partial
  linear history, you can undo and redo changes.  Where tree undo
  differs from partial linear history is when you undo and then make a
  new change.  Instead of throwing away the undid changes, Vim will
  create another branch in the undo tree.  This makes it possible to
  restore those changes later on, but you need to use obscure commands
  to jump across undo tree branches or use a visualization tool.
</p>

<p>
  Undo trees can be used like partial linear history by ignoring the
  other branches of the undo tree, and the basic usage is easy to
  understand.  Taking advantage of the other branches of the undo tree
  is possible but harder to do and understand; it's out of reach of
  the casual user.
</p>

<p>
  Emacs has a different, unique implementation of undo.  Changes are
  put onto a linear history, and when you undo, the undid changes are
  also put onto the undo history.  Therefore, you can redo undid
  changes simply by undoing again.
</p>

<p>
  This is how undo in Emacs is usually explained, and it sounds more
  complicated than it really is.  Basically, undoing in Emacs lets you
  return the text to a previous state, no matter what sequence of
  undos, redos, and other changes led to and away from that state.
  Undo in Emacs shares the advantage of undo trees of not throwing
  away history without requiring the user to recall the exact series
  of steps the user made, in order to jump back to the right branch of
  the undo tree.
</p>

<p>
  The way undo works in Emacs also makes it easy to do things like
  undo changes within a specific region of text.  In partial linear
  undo and undo tree, implementing undoing within a region is
  difficult: does that count as an undo?  What happens if you redo or
  make new changes?  What happens if you undo again?  But in Emacs it
  is trivial.  Any time the text changes, that becomes a point on the
  undo history that you can return to.
</p>

<p>
  As digital information grows more and more pervasive, information is
  becoming easier to copy, modify, restore, and destroy.  Undo was
  critical when people first began to adopt computers, for it is all
  too easy for a novice to delete pages of text with a single movement
  of a finger.  Even now, it is not uncommon for users to
  inadvertently destroy data in a way that undo and other backup
  mechanisms cannot help them recover.  Emacs's implementation of undo
  is a small oasis of comfort; if you keep pressing undo, you can
  always get back to what you had before.
