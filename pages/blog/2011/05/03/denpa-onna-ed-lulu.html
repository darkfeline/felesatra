<i>Lulu</i>'s melody was very simple and easy, taking me all of fifteen
minutes to take down. Textbook B Major, simple rhythm, et cetera.  Thus,
I took the liberty of flexing my aural muscles and tackling the harmony
parts as well.
</p>

<p>
Among the instruments present are drums and chimes, but I only
transcribed the piano snippets and the bass (I believe it is) trombone
line, as those two are the most important bits.  I had trouble
discerning some parts of the background bass voices (I'm really not good
with bass), so at some places, notably measures 9-10, I simplified it to
what sounds right instead of trying to attain note-for-note accuracy.
</p>

<p>
Other little things:
</p>

<p>
I decided not to include the chords since there weren't any clear chords
actually part of the song (that I could find), this isn't a song that is
receptive of comping, and if you really wanted to, you could just bang
out B Major and related chords and be perfectly fine.
</p>

<p>
I debated over how to articulate various notes. Articulation is an
important part of the song, but putting staccatos on a soft vocal melody
is a little jarring for me, since I'm used to the sharp classical
staccato.  I'm also not acquainted with articulation on bass brasswinds,
so in the end I just put staccatos on short piano notes.
