title: From Jekyll to Pelican
---

<p>
  I believe, was that Jekyll lacked pagination.  That Pelican is written in
  Python About a month or so ago I moved my blog from Jekyll to Pelican.  The
  motivation, as opposed to Ruby is but a bonus.  Ultimately, both are static
  site generators and the plain text format makes migrations largely a matter of
  writing short scripts to convert between formats.
