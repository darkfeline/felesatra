いのりちゃんはかわいい！  Ahem.  This is the second of the set of Guilty
Crown songs, but unfortunately, Euterpe looks like it'll have to wait.
A nice, slow ED, perfect for closing the often shocking episodes that
the anime offers.  Hmm, "shocking" is probably a bad word for it; how
about "awesome", with its literal meaning?  That seems to fit.  Watch
Guilty Crown, if you feel anything, it would be awe.

<dd>It pains me to read my past articles.  Guilty Crown was fun to watch,
but I wouldn't recommend nearly as much now.</dd>
