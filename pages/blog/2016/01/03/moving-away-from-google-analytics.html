title: Moving away from Google Analytics

<p>
I am proud of the fact that this website uses very little JavaScript.  None of
it is essential, and the JavaScript that is used exists to provide supplementary
functionality to the content on each page.  Things like dynamically generated
tables of contents provide convenience for the user, but the content is
available without JavaScript.  This is good, and I was happy to provide such a
well-made site in the wake of the embarrassments that now populate the Web.
However, there was one outlier: the Google Analytics code included in the header
of every page.
</p>

<p>
Google Analytics sucks.  It sucks for a number of reasons: from a technical
perspective, it is actually quite marvelous, though fundamentally flawed for
reasons I will get to later.  The other reason it sucks is that large scale user
tracking and privacy infringement is antisocial, malicious, and quite evil.
Whether or not user tracking is immoral, whether or not it is even useful, and
whether or not Big Data is completely misguided would be an interesting topic of
discussion for elsewhere.  Suffice to say it should be something that one opts
in to, not something that one opts out of.  When I browse websites, I block
Google Analytics, so including it on my site was rather hypocritical.
</p>

<p>
For a small personal website like this, analytics isn't a crucial operational
component; it's just nice to have.  I can use it to monitor page hits, which
makes me feel nice knowing that people visit my site.  I can use it to see
roughly what visitors are interested in and roughly what kind of people they
might be.  Up until now, I have used Google Analytics because it was convenient,
but it had always made me uncomfortable to sell out my readers to <del>Big
Brother</del><ins>Google</ins>, so I have finally removed it.  Now, I use my web
server logs and FOSS software for my analytics needs.

<h1>Getting analytics data</h1>

<p>
For analytics, you need data.  Google Analytics gets its data from the
JavaScript code embedded in webpages, as well as any and all applicable data
from other parts of the Google hivemind.  I now get my data from my web server
logs.
</p>

<p>
What information does the server have access to?  In order to get a webpage, the
client must request the page from the server.  The server therefore has access
to all of the information in the request headers, such as who sent the request,
when the request was received, and what was requested.
</p>

<p>
The request headers contain a lot of auxiliary information, including the user
agent and referrer fields.  These headers can be useful for
analytics and potentially damaging to one's privacy, but they can be forged or
omitted, so their value depends on whether or not they can be corroborated with
other, more trustworthy data.
</p>

<p>
What subset of this information is available in the server logs depends on your
server and configuration.  A server that keeps logs merely for diagnostic
purposes might only keep the time of each request, the page that was requested,
and the IP that requested it, whereas a server depending on them for analytics
might log everything and send it to a database instead of a log file on the
server.

<h1>Analytics with server logs</h1>

<p>
With data in hand, the analysis can be done however you want.  On the simple
side, one might simply plot the number of requests per day to see whether there
are any interesting patterns, such as peaks on weekends.  On the other extreme,
one could throw state of the art machine learning algorithms at the data to
identify individuals and their browsing habits, like Google no doubt does.
</p>

<p>
For me, some basic reporting is sufficient.  Two programs I have found and tried
are visitors and GoAccess.  visitors is old: it doesn't recognize Chrome's User
Agent, for example, and its reports are visually simple.  GoAccess is newer and
primarily intended for live monitoring, though it can generate reports too.
Both work well.
</p>

<p>
After playing with both, I settled on a short script for generating reports:
</p>

{% call codeblock() %}
#!/bin/bash

scp -r user@server.example.com:/var/log/webserver logs
find logs -name "*.gz" | parallel gunzip
cat logs/* | goaccess -p ~/.goaccessrc -a > report.html
{% endcall %}

<h1>Some analytics for this site</h1>

<p>
Before I finish, I'd like to share some general insights I got from this site's
analytics.
</p>

<p>
First, from Google Analytics.  There was a peak in visits in the latter half of
December, with an average of about 30 per day.  Before that, the average was
around 7 per day.  Of the roughly 300 visits in the past month, almost all go to
<code>/</code> (the homepage).  There were 250 Chrome users and 40 Firefox
users.
</p>

<aside>
If you do the math, the numbers don't seem to match up.  This is due to the
dirty details involved in tracking visits, sessions, unique users as opposed
to raw page hits.
</aside>

<p>
Next, from my server logs.  There was a fairly even distribution of visits in
November and December, averaging roughly 60 per day.  There were a total of 3000
visits to <code>/</code>, and 150 visits to <code>/robots.txt</code> (these
requests failed, as this site uses <code>/index.xml</code> instead).  There were
2000 web crawlers, 1500 Firefox users, and 100 Chrome users.
</p>

<p>
There are huge discrepancies in the data from Google Analytics and my server
logs.  In particular, Google Analytics only tracked 10% of the actual visits to
my site.  This brings me to my earlier point, Google Analytics not only sucks
morally, it sucks technically as well.
</p>

<p>
I'm not qualified to give deep insights about this, but I suspect the reason is
JavaScript blocking.  Web crawlers and bots did not show up in Google Analytics
because they do not execute JavaScript, but many human users (or visitors that
appear to be human users) did not show up either.  As the average user grows
more and more aware of privacy issues and begins blocking tracking ads and
scripts, Google Analytics and other forms of JavaScript tracking are just going
to suck more and more.
</p>

<p>
P.S.: For you bots and script kiddies poking at phpMyAdmin and cgi-bin, this
site is completely static.  I wish you good luck trying to exploit the HTML
files.
