  <h1>About this site</h1>

  <p>
    This is my personal website, and thus it hosts content that I feel
    like hosting.  This is includes my own posts and assorted pages
    that I have written and now maintain, but if you have any content
    that you would like me to host, feel free to contact me; I will
    host it if I like it.

    <p>
      This site may not look like what you're used to, because this
      site aims to serve semantically correct HTML documents with
      useful content, and not visual noise.
