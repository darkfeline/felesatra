title: What is "meta"
---
<p>
  What does "meta" mean in the context of games?  "Meta" means Most
  Effective Tactics Available.  Except it doesn't!
</p>

<p>
  I love the truth and I hate lies.  To rewrite history is to falsify
  it, and the history of our language is the history of our society.
  The word "meta" traces an important path through gaming culture and
  I'll be damned if I let it be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
  "Meta" is the shortened form of "metagame", and to understand the
  concept of metagaming we have to look at imperfect information games
  like RTSes.
</p>

<p>
  Consider a game where two players choose a card simultaneously at
  the beginning of the game, and the card chosen influences which
  player wins.  There is a card Foo which wins against almost all
  other cards.  There is also a card Bar which loses against almost
  all other cards, except it wins against Foo.
</p>

<p>
  When this game is first played, many people will pick Foo as it is
  superior in almost all situations.  However, some players will
  notice that everyone is picking Foo and start picking Bar.
  Objectively, Bar is a worse choice looking at the
  stats <em>within</em> the game, but if you look at what people
  do <em>outside</em> of the game, Bar is the better choice because it
  will give you an advantage most of the time in practice.  This is
  the <em>metagame</em>, playing the game not based off the game
  mechanics, but off of how other players play the game.
</p>

<p>
  The metagame (or meta for short) is constantly shifting and is not
  directly related to what's objectively good based solely on the game
  mechanics.  Playing the meta involves keeping up with what other
  players are doing and staying one step ahead.  Going back to our
  hypothetical game, more and more players will start to notice and
  start picking Bar instead of Foo, until some equilibrium is reached
  which gives both Foo and Bar players the advantage roughly 50% of
  the time.  However, the players on top of the meta may start to pick
  Baz, which is strong against Bar.  Baz is weak against Foo, but less
  so than other cards.  This gives Baz players an advantage against
  the ~50% of Bar players and a lower disadvantage against the ~50% of
  Foo players, netting them a ~60% advantage overall, higher than the
  50% of Foo and Bar players.  Thus, the meta progresses.
</p>

<p>
  The popularity of these kinds of competitive games has declined
  greatly in the past decades, and with the speed of information
  nowadays, any metagame will achieve equilibrium rapidly.  Thus, the
  idea of playing the metagame has fallen out of popularity.  "Meta"
  has been simplified to refer to "what you should do to achieve the
  best outcome" and is being used in games that lack a metagame, such
  as single player games.
</p>

<p>
  I am well aware that language changes over time, and I am not salty
  about the changes.  What I am upset about is when people forget the
  history behind the changes.  Humans are short-lived, and their
  attention spans and memory even more so.  I see many gamers nowaday
  who are ignorant of the history of the word "meta", and the
  backronym "Most Effective Tactics Available" has created a false
  etymology.
</p>

<p>
  A false etymology is a lie to future generations, and I hate lies.
  Though I am but one person, I felt compelled to let you know, dear
  reader, with the hope that gamers do not forget what the real meta is.
