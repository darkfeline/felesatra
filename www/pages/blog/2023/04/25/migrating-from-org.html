title: Migrating from Org mode to Markdown
---
<p>
  As a long-time Emacs user, I am of course aware of Org mode and have
  used it extensively.  However, I have been looking for alternatives
  and recently switched from Org mode to Obsidian for the bulk of my
  notes.
</p>

<p>
  Why would someone who is enlightened give up the editing power of
  Emacs for an Electron app?  Am I going through the same phase as
  Neal Stephenson and become an Eloi?  Actually, I still use Emacs to
  edit my notes.
</p>

<p>
  Obsidian is a propriety offline Electron application for taking
  notes, with support for backlinks and graph view.  It is priced
  reasonably at $0 for most users, and it saves all of its data (that
  is, all of your data) as Markdown files.  The last point is crucial,
  because Markdown is a widely used standard, thus enabling me to edit
  the files in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
  So it is better to say that I switched from Org mode not to
  Obsidian, but to Markdown.  I still use Org mode for its power and
  extensibility in specific cases, but it is that power which makes
  Org mode undesirable for the general case because that power is only
  available from Emacs.  Outside of Emacs, without that power, Org
  mode is simply a markup language that is incompatible with and
  unsupported by all other software.  You could use Pandoc to export
  it as a better supported format, but why not use that other format
  to begin with?
</p>

  Some of you may be itching to point out that Markdown is not
  standardized, and you'd be technically correct.  But it is also
  technically correct that despite the lack of a standard, you could
  pick a Markdown file and it would be far better supported across far
  more applications and libraries than an Org file.  The core bits of
  Markdown are a de facto standard, and Markdown is so widely used
  that you could easily translate between flavors with various tools.
  That's the power of <a href="/blog/2015/03/11/why-holy-wars-matter">market share</a>.
