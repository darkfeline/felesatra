title: Beyond functional options in Go
---
<p>
  In 2014, Dave Cheney talked
  about <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2014/10/17/functional-options-for-friendly-apis">functional
  option pattern</a>, which has since then taken off in the Go
  ecosystem.  They have some advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>They provide a future-proof API that can be freely extended.</li>
  <li>They make optional setting with non-zero defaults easier to handle.</li>
  <li>They can directly manipulate the object to be initialized.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I have both implemented and used many functional option APIs, and my
  opinion of them has chilled greatly over time.  In practice,
  functional options are almost always used to set a traditional
  options struct.  The ability for the option itself to initialize the
  object (what I will call "real functional options") is certainly
  clever, but cleverness is not a positive feature in engineering.
</p>

<p>
  Functional options have a number of flaws.  Ensuring that real
  functional options interact properly (for example, one option which
  may unintentionally override part of another option if passed in the
  wrong order) is a headache that would be avoided with an options
  struct.  Also, many options cannot be initialized directly on an
  object, but have to be considered together with other options.  This
  is why in practice functional option implementations generally fall
  back to an options struct.  Thus implementations generally
  use an interface without any public methods, unlike Dave's original
  example:
</p>

<pre><code>type FooOption interface {
	// only private methods, so other packages cannot implement options
}

func NewFoo(o ...FooOption) (*Foo, error) {...}
</code></pre>

<p>
  Are options structs really so bad?  Let's compare then against the
  supposed advantages of functional options.
</p>

<p>
  If you're following the Go backward compatibility guidelines,
  functional options do not make an API more future-proof.  Just as
  you can add a new functional option, you can add a new field to an
  options struct.  You would still need to support any previously
  added options and ensure they interact correctly with the new option
  that may replace them.  Indeed, ensuring correct interaction with
  deprecated options is one reason why functional option
  implementations in practice all use options structs.
</p>

<p>
  For the second point, it's true that non-zero default values are
  awkward to handle with options structs, but they can usually be
  accommodated.  If the zero value is invalid, then it can be
  translated to the default value.  If the zero value is valid, it can
  be mapped to a magic value like <code>-1</code>.  The behavior can
  be documented in the field comment.
</p>

<p>
  Finally, option structs cannot directly emulate real functional
  options.  However, as described earlier however, real functional
  options are rarely useful.
</p>

<p>
  You may ask, even if option structs are not inferior to functional
  options, that is no reason to not use functional options.  Well,
  functional options also have some disadvantages.  They add overhead
  as they create closure objects for every option.  They also hinder
  discoverability of what options are available, even if that can
  be made easier using IDE functionality.  If you asked me whether I
  would want to hunt down a dozen functional option constructor
  functions for their doc comments or deal with awkward default
  values, I would gladly take the latter if it meant I could see all
  of the options in one place!
</p>

<p>
  If you really aren't convinced, then might I suggest a middle
  ground: interface struct options.  The beauty of interfaces in Go is
  that any value that implements an interface can be used as such, so
  we don't have to stick with function values:
</p>

<pre><code>type FooOption interface {
	fooOption()
}

type FooOpt struct {
	SomeTimeout int
}

func (*FooOpt) fooOption() {}

func NewFoo(o ...FooOption) (*Foo, error) {
	opt := &amp;FooOpt{}
	for _, o := range o {
		switch o.(type) {
		case *FooOpt:
			opt = o
		}
	}
	// ...
}

func main() {
	f, err := NewFoo(&amp;FooOpt{
		SomeTimeout: 5,
	})
}
</code></pre>
