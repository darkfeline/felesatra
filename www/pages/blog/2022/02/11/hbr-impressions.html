title: Heaven Burns Red early impressions
---

<p>
  tl&semi;dr HBR is a VN/JRPG written by Key.  Also it has gacha I guess.
</p>

<p>
Heaven Burns Red is a newly released JP gacha game (soshage/mobage)
with lots of big names behind it.  I played it since release and IMO
it's bretty good so I want to share my early impressions.
</p>

<h1>Setting</h1>

<p>
Monsters called Cancer (that look like crabs) have invaded and humans
invented weapons called Seraph to fight back.  The main cast is a
bunch of young girls at a military base cum school.  There are
ostensibly men, but they are kept separated from the girls (or so we
are told).
</p>

<h1>Overall gameplay</h1>

<p>
The game is about 70% VN/story and 30% dungeons/battles.  If you don't
care about the story this game is probably not for you.
</p>

<p>
The VN sections are standard VN fare with 2D art.  Exploration is in a
pretty 3D world that you navigate as a side scroller.  Battles use the
same 3D engine and are like a standard JRPG.
</p>

<h1>Key, WFS, Maeda Jun, Yuugen, Yanagi Nagi</h1>

<p>
One of the big selling points of HBR is its all star cast.
</p>

<p>
Key is the company behind Clannad, Air, Kanon, Angel Beats, Little
Busters, etc.
</p>

<p>
I'm not very familiar with Wright Flyer Studios, but they seem to be
an established game dev.  They developed Another Eden and After Lost.
</p>

<p>
Maeda Jun is Key's main writer and behind many (all?) of Key's works.
I'll get to him more when I talk about the story.
</p>

<p>
Yuugen is the artist behind many Gust/Atelier games.  He drew Plachta
in Atelier Sophie, who is a cutie pie, fight me.
</p>

<p>
Yanagi Nagi is a singer who has done many songs for Key games and
anime.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't heard of these names, you probably aren't into
anime/weeb stuff and HBR might not be for you.
</p>

<h1>Music, art, animation</h1>

<p>
The music, art, animation are all good, consistent quality.  They're
not mindblowing.  Yanagi Nagi's insert songs are Yanagi Nagi songs.
Yuugen's art is Yuugen art.
</p>

<p>
The 3D models and animations are comparable to Gust's newer games.
Speaking of which, the game stylistically feels very similar to Blue
Reflection.
</p>

<h1>Story and characters</h1>

<p>
Let's talk story, which is 70% of the game.
</p>

<p>
The story is Key and Maeda Jun.  If you've watched or played any two
Key works, you know what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
Slice of life, tsukkomi routines, characters with unique/tragic
backstory, obligatory band performance, you know the drill.  There
will probably be a dark twist later on and lots of crying.
</p>

<p>
The story isn't bad.  It's executed very well.  But if you don't like
Key/Maeda, then you'll skip the story.  Like standard VNs, there are
skip/autoplay/FF button.
</p>

<p>
The MC is a boyish girl who used to be a rock star (of course Maeda)
who is moderately gay, depending on the dialogue options you pick.
Speaking of the dialogue options, I had to laugh out loud at some of
the shenanigans you can pick.  Again, think Clannad humor.
</p>

<h1>Battle mechanics</h1>

<p>
Now let's talk about the remaining 30% of the game, the battle stuff.
</p>

<p>
The game is a pretty standard JRPG.  You have a party of 6 units.
Every turn, you pick 3 units to move into the front line and attack.
You can freely control turn order.  Units have a normal attack and up
to three equippable skills.  Skills use SP which regenerate every
turn.
</p>

<p>
There is an Overdrive gauge which builds as you attack and when filled
you can activate it to give you an SP boost and free turns (i.e.,
skipping the enemy's turn).
</p>

<p>
There is a rock-paper-scissors type system.
</p>

<p>
All of this is pretty standard JRPG except perhaps the freely swapping
units part.  However, there are two unique core mechanics.  The first
is DP, deflector points.  DP is like a shield and applies to both your
units and enemies.  Generally speaking, you can only heal DP and only
if your DP isn't broken by hitting 0.  If any unit loses all HP then
it's game over.  So DP is kind of like your normal HP and HP is your
emergency pool in case you're one turn away from winning.
</p>

<p>
I like the DP mechanic for your units because it avoids the "oh
they're just fainted at 0 HP" or "just chug a potion to regenerate"
crap that 99% of games use.
</p>

<p>
Enemies also have DP, and it serves a couple of functions.  First, it
prevents you from one-shotting enemies (since you can't overkill DP).
Note that this applies to you too, so if you have more than 0 DP you
can't be one shot.  Although also note that this doesn't work against
multi hit attacks.  Second, some skills get bonus damage versus DP or
HP, so you need to balance your party for both.
</p>

<p>
The second unique mechanic is "destruction".  Enemies have a
"destruction" ratio for their HP that affects how much HP damage they
take.  The ratio increases as you attack them, meaning enemies take
more and more damage, but there are skills that specifically increase
destruction ratio.  This mechanic mostly affects spongey bosses, where
you need to build your party with such skills.
</p>

<p>
There is speed up and auto battle functions.  Auto battle is stupider
than manual play but good enough if you're overleveled.  You can
configure which skills the auto battle uses to reduce the stupidity a
little, although IMO you're better off playing manually at that point.
</p>

<h1>Character building</h1>

<p>
HBR uses a skin system, called styles.  Styles come from the gacha.
There are 48 characters in the game (8 teams/"factions"/"guilds" with
6 members each), and I doubt the base roster is going to increase any
time soon.  Each character has multiple styles.  You can only equip
one style per character and only use one copy of the character in your
party.
</p>

<p>
Each style has unlockable skills, stat modifiers, and passives.
Skills and stat modifiers need to be unlocked via farmed mats.  Most
skills once unlocked can be used regardless of the equipped style
(although some skills are locked to the style), and most stat
modifiers and passives are locked to the style (although some stat
modifiers apply to the character universally).
</p>

<p>
You can limit break styles using dupe shards, which increases the
level limit of the character (NOT the style) and the style's base stat
modifiers.
</p>

<p>
Characters can equip various equipment, which are not from gacha, has
no stat RNG and aren't leveled.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I quite like the character building so far.  The only thing
you have to grind for are mats to unlock the skills and stats for
styles.  Sweet and simple.
</p>

<p>
tl&semi;dr level characters, upgrade styles with mats, and farm/buy
equipment for characters.
</p>

<h1>Repeatable content and dailies</h1>

<p>
The maximum stamina (called Life) is 5 and you gain 1 stamina per 4
hours.
</p>

<p>
You can spend 1 stamina to do Prism Arena, which are boss fights that
drop skill mats, or you can spend 2 stamina to do a dungeon which
contains accessories.
</p>

<p>
Dungeons are basically dungeons in JRPGs but simpler.  You explore the
dungeon which is mostly empty hallways with items to pick up at
various places (functionally the same as chests), and RANDOM
ENCOUNTERS.  There is a white/yellow/red indicator that shows your
chance of an encounter as you explore.  There are also boss enemies
that appear on the map.
</p>

<p>
Normally random encounters are kind of iffy in JRPGs IMO but the
entire point of dungeons in HBR is fighting encounters.  You have a
limited amount of energy per dungeon run which depletes as you fight
encounters.  Once you run out of energy you start losing HP per turn
in battle, so you're pretty much forced to retreat.
</p>

<p>
You also have to do dungeons to unlock more bosses for Prism Arena.
</p>

<p>
tl&semi;dr, spend 1 stamina to fight a boss, spend 2 stamina to fight ~10
mix of mob/boss encounters.
</p>

<p>
The daily mission is to spend 3 stamina, and that's it.  You only get
6 stamina every day if you haven't done the math in your head yet.
</p>

<p>
IMO, the daily grind is probably the lowest among gacha games.
</p>

<p>
Now, there's one final thing called arena.  It costs no stamina to do
and gives a tiny amount of XP, gold, and basic mats.
</p>

<p>
You can autoplay arena offline.  First, you have to beat an arena
stage normally (you can use auto battle), and then the game records
how much time you took to clear it and uses that to calculate how many
runs you do.
</p>

<p>
Example: You clear the stage in 1 minute and leave it to autoplay for
an hour.  The game gives you the rewards for 60 runs.  (It actually
adds extra seconds to your first clear time, but this is just an
example.)
</p>

<p>
The cap for autoplay starts at 8 hours and increases by 20 minutes per
player rank.
</p>

<p>
If you want to min-max, then you're going to have to check in every X
hours to set the autoplay (which will probably still take less time
than many gacha games honestly), but IMO it's not necessary.  The
XP/gold/mats is very valuable in the first few days of play but the
value diminishes as you progress.  If you do (ab)use autoplay, you
will be overleveled for the main story content.
</p>

<p>
In terms of end game content, there is no end game content.  Of
course, that's true of most games, especially gacha games.  You will
login to burn stamina on prism arena for a few minutes.  Wait for the
next content release.
</p>

<h1>Gacha</h1>

<p>
Oh right, HBR is a gacha game.  Let's talk about gacha.
</p>

<p>
The gacha is only for styles (no weapon banners here).  You unlock
characters by pulling any style for that character.  Style rarities
are A, S, SS.  The rate for SS is 3%.  Pity is 200 pulls and doesn't
carry across banners.  I think the pity is for the banner rate up, but
we haven't had any rate up banners yet.
</p>

<p>
Pulling dupes gets you pieces to limit break styles, but if you have
already maxed that style, you get universal pieces that can limit
break any of that character's styles.  So a F2P could reasonably max
out any SS styles they pull given a long time.
</p>

<p>
There is no PVP.  So far, there is no content that needs top meta
styles to clear.  In the early game, you probably want to pull to
unlock all the characters so you can see their friendship events,
rather than pulling for meta SS styles.
</p>

<p>
One pull is 300 quartz.  You get 110 quartz from daily missions (which
if you remember is just spending 3 stamina), and 20 from the login
bonus (100 on the 7th day).  Yes, you get quartz from every day of the
login bonus.
</p>

<p>
Adding that up, you get 990 quartz guaranteed every week, which is
kind of generous now that I've done the math.  YMMV.
</p>

<p>
No idea about events yet.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I would say HBR's gacha is average and the game is average to
above average for F2P friendliness.
</p>

<h1>Rerolling</h1>

<p>
Rerolling is fast.  You can clear your player data from the login
screen and skip the tutorial.  You still need to skip through a few
dialogue scenes however.  You get one guaranteed SS, 1 ten roll
ticket, and enough quartz for another 10 roll.
</p>

<p>
Account binding is via ID/password, so you can easily save multiple
reroll accounts if you want to chase that ULTIMATE REROLL F2P BTW.
</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>
In conclusion, Karen is best girl and I would totally let her murder
me.
