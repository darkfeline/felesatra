title: The Ending of Nier: Automata

<p><strong>Warning: This contains major spoilers for the game.  Do not
read this unless you have played through Ending E.  Do not read this
even if you don't care about spoilers.  You must play the game without
spoilers.</strong></p>

<p>
Oh boy, where do I even begin?  Maybe I should begin at the end, since
I still remember it so vividly.  I don't think I will ever forget it.  I
wasn't even trying to get Ending E, I was grabbing an L Part near the
end to upgrade the laser pod, and I decided to grab the other ending
(Ending D) while I was at it, since there are no save spots after that
point.
</p>

<p>
When the credits rolled and the pods talked about the data noise, I
wasn't sure what to pick.  I picked Yes.  When the pod mentioned the
personal data of 2B, 9S, A2 and deleting them, I thought I fucked up.
I should've ignored the data noise so the leaked data didn't get
deleted.  When the other pod denied the request.  I <em>felt</em> the
game.  When the pod said it was unsatisfied with the conclusion,
I <em>felt</em> that.  When the pod said it wanted the main characters
to survive, I <em>felt</em> that.
</p>

<p>
  Then the credits rewound and I saw Ending E.  I wasn't looking for it
  and I found the final ending.
</p>

<p>
I fought through all of the credits without dying until the Square
Enix (I have some experience with shmups like Touhou although I'm not
a pro by any means).  The game asked me if I wanted to give up.  I can
try a few more times.  The game asked me if games were silly.  Fuck no,
now it's personal.  The game asked me if the world has no meaning.  Fuck
no.
</p>

<p>
Since I was playing blind, I didn't know if the game was going to help
me out or not.  I felt like it might, but I heard about Yoko Taro
being a troll.  Doesn't matter, I was prepared to go through to the
end.  I beat Celeste without cheats, dying over and over.  If I had to
beat this myself, then by God I would do it.  I saw the messages of
all of the people encouraging me.  They could do it.  I can do this.
</p>

<p>
Then Zelda offered to help.  Oh, here's the game throwing me the bone,
I thought.  With my newfound firepower, I started blasting.  I wasn't
sure what would happen if I died again, so I played more recklessly.
I got hit and I saw the message at the side of the screen.  "Zelda's
data has been lost."
</p>

<p>
Oh shit.  I wasn't sure what that meant at the time, but I felt like I
had to play more carefully.  I assumed that players registered a
message at the end of the game, and when I died, their message got
deleted.  Not a huge deal, but I had the shmup skills, so I did my
best and got through only getting hit one or two more times.
</p>

<p>
The final ending scene was perfect.  The little bit of humor about
life being a constant stream of embarrassments.  The question about
whether anything will change.  Saying we have to grasp the possibility
of the future.  The ending scene was short, but every second of that
scene was utilized fully.  The ending scene was left open, but that
was all I needed.  Not a happy ending where all the problems get
solved.  Just a ray of hope.  Beating the credits was worth it.
</p>

<p>
After that, I got asked to leave a message.  I expected this, and hell
yeah I left a message.  The game asked me if I wanted to help others.
Hell yes.  Would I give up my save data for that?  Ah, now I know what
that message meant.
</p>

<p>
I wasn't planning on getting Ending E.  I still had a few quests to
finish.  I still had a few weapons to upgrade.  I didn't collect all
of the archive items, I didn't finish the colosseums.  I do have some
backups, as I keep nightly backups of my computer, but I would still
be losing the hours of progress I made today.
</p>

<p>
Would I give up my save data for someone I hated?  Of course, even my
worst enemy deserves to see the conclusion of this awesome experience.
</p>

<p>
Would I give up my save data, even if it was just for show?  I'm a
programmer, a logical thinker.  My subconscious is racing, analyzing
the situation.  I still wasn't sure if the game would actually delete
my data or if it was a test.  There was no way other players deleted
their data to only help one person, because the average player is
going to be dying more than me, and I died more than once.  The number
of lives used up had to be more than the number of players giving up
their data.  So this has to be for show.  Would I give up my save
data, even if it was just for show?
</p>

<p>
Would I TRULY give up my save data?  I still wasn't sure if the game
would actually do it.  If it did, I could restore from my backup.  But
the game was testing me.  At this point, it no longer mattered if it
actually would delete my data or not.  The game was testing me.  Are
games just silly little things?  Was I prepared to start the game from
the very beginning if I wanted to 100% it?
</p>

<p>
At the new title screen, I had to check.  There was no "Continue"
option.  The madman has actually done it.  He's actually done it.
</p>

<p>
I stepped away from my computer for a few minutes to try to make sense
of all these feelings.  And now, a few days later, I still can't stop
thinking about the game.  That's why I'm writing this.
</p>

<p>
If you're wondering, I went back and hit "New Game".  I didn't restore
my backup.  It felt wrong.
</p>
