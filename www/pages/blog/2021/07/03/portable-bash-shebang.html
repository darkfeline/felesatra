title: Portable Bash Shebangs
modified: 2021-07-06

<p>
  This post is going to be about a bit of POSIX trivia which is not
  likely to be very useful in practice.  Still, it's an interesting
  bit of trivia, so if that interests you, read on.
</p>

<p>
  I'm going to assume that you know what shebangs are.  If you wanted
  to make an executable script that is run with Bash, you would add a
  line like <code>#!/bin/bash</code> to the top.
</p>

<p>
  However, shebangs are not actually portable under POSIX.  First of
  all, the shebang itself (<code>#!</code>) is not defined under
  POSIX.  Second of all, the paths of POSIX utilities are not
  specified.  <code>sh</code> could be located at <code>/bin/sh</code>
  or <code>/usr/bin/sh</code> or
  <code>/screw/you/this/is/still/posix/sh</code>.  The same goes
  for <code>env</code>, so <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> is also
  not portable.
</p>

<p>
  There is a way to make an actually portable executable Bash script
  under POSIX (assuming <code>bash</code> is somewhere in
  your <code>PATH</code> of course), by taking advantage of a little
  known behavior in POSIX.  When you execute a file, and the file does
  not match a binary executable format, then the OS will execute the
  default shell and pass the file as the first argument.

    There are two distinct ways in which the contents of the process image
    file may cause the execution to fail, distinguished by the setting of
    errno to either [ENOEXEC] or [EINVAL] (see the ERRORS section). In the
    cases where the other members of the exec family of functions would
    fail and set errno to [ENOEXEC], the execlp() and execvp() functions
    shall execute a command interpreter and the environment of the
    executed command shall be as if the process invoked the sh utility
    using execl() as follows:
  </p>

  <pre><code>execl(&lt;shell path&gt;, arg0, file, arg1, ..., (char *)0);</code></pre>

  <p>
    where &lt;shell path&gt; is an unspecified pathname for the sh utility, file
    is the process image file, and for execvp(), where arg0, arg1, and so
    on correspond to the values passed to execvp() in argv[0], argv[1],
    and so on.

  Std 1003.1-2017 exec</a></cite>
</p>

<p>
  Note how it specifically points out that the shell path is
  unspecified.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, we can use this to write a portable Bash script like so:
</p>

<pre><code># This will be run with the default shell, usually "/bin/sh".
# This stanza is valid in both POSIX shell and Bash.
# If we aren't in Bash, then we exec bash from the PATH.
# In Bash, BASH_VERSION is set so we will skip this.
# On OSX, you can check the version if you're trying to use a newer Bash.
if [ -z "${BASH_VERSION}" ]; then
    exec bash "$0" "$@"
fi

# Put the Bash script contents here.
echo "${BASH_VERSION}"
echo "$0" "$@"
</code></pre>

<p>
  Unfortunately, this cannot replace all uses of shebangs, only those
  for programs that can tolerate the initial POSIX shell stanza.
  Also, you would never need to do this in practice since all
  Unix-like OSes in common use support the familiar shebang behavior.
  Still, it is an interesting bit of trivia to discuss over lunch.
