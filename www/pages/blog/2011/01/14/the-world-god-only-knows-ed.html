Sorry, guys, but no lyrics or chords for this one!  For some reason or
another, Lilypond seems to disagree with my syntax somewhere, and it
doesn't help that my Lilypond code for this song was essentially a glob
of letters and numbers with voices interspersed throughout.  Doing this
song and God only knows, I'm beginning to appreciate the polyphony that
Kaminomi is in love with, and I'm hating it as well because it
obfuscates what would otherwise be clear Lilypond code.  Ah, well.
There's a lot of songs that I've been eying recently and I still need to
finish God only knows, so I'm hoping that experience will help me to get
Lilypond to cooperate, at which point I'll be able to provide better
formatted and embellished sheet music for you guys.
