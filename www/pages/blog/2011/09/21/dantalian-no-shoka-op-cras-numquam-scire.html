Sorry about the hiatus.  I'm starting college, and the transition makes
finding an opportunity to transcribe, and I think my desire to get down
every voice exactly is frustrating me.  Maybe I should just try piano
reductions....
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, Cras numquam scire.  It's a simple song, although partway
through when a bunch of harmony lines started entering I gave up on the
chords.  Matching up the Latin—I think it's Latin—lyrics to the notes
was painful.  The lyrical feel of the song, the piano and violin
harmony, and the Latin lyrics makes this song a really good theme for
the anime, which explores knowledge and forbidden knowledge, using the
metaphor of books, and lightly referencing a wide range of myths,
legends and stories.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to remind my readers again that I'm just a newbie
transcriber, and I welcome anyone with advice or looking for advice—
maybe one of you would like to try transcribing, too.  The Internet is a
great place for creating, and it's unfortunate that only a small portion
of people on the Internet create and a large portion only consume.  Try
something, make a blog, draw picture, compose songs.  The Internet is a
(mostly) friendly place, and it's fun!

    Yes, it is indeed Latin, now that I have studied it.  "Cras numquam
    scire" roughly means "never to know tomorrow".
