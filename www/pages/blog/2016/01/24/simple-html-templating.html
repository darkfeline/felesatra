title: Simple HTML templating
---
<p>
In this age of booming web development, there are web frameworks available
for pushing out a web application as quickly as possible.  However, sometimes
that's too much and all you need is a static site, so you pick from one of the
  many <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static site generators</a> and start building
your site.
</p>

<p>
  Sometimes even that's too much. You need to write a few HTML pages, and all you
  want is a simple HTML templating tool so you don't have to type <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> a dozen times.
</p>

<p>
In the modern app-driven world, you would be hard-pressed to find such a tool
("simple" isn't in the vocabulary), but the old UNIX world offers a solution:
M4.
</p>

<p>
M4 is a general text preprocessing tool and works nicely for templating HTML.
Make header and footer templates:
</p>

<pre><code>m4_dnl header.m4
m4_dnl These lines can be used as comments.
m4_dnl "dnl" means "delete to newline".
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;TITLE&lt;/title&gt;
m4_dnl This placeholder TITLE will be replaced later.
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;

m4_dnl footer.m4
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
Write your content:
</p>

<pre><code>m4_dnl index.m4
m4_define(TITLE, My home page)m4_dnl
m4_dnl The m4_define here defines a macro.
m4_dnl "TITLE" will now be replaced with "My home page".
m4_dnl That includes the "TITLE" in our header template.
m4_dnl The "m4_dnl" after the "m4_define" removes the newline.
m4_dnl It's only needed if you care about blank lines in the output.
m4_include(header.m4)m4_dnl
m4_dnl Here we include our header template.
&lt;h1&gt;My home page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;
m4_include(footer.m4)m4_dnl
m4_dnl Here we include our footer template.
</code></pre>

<p>
Then run:
</p>

<pre><code>$ m4 -P index.m4 > index.html
</code></pre>

<p>
It's as simple as that.  M4 offers other functions as well, so if you don't need
a full static site generator, M4 should be able to fulfill any specific demands
you have.
