title: Jujutsu is great for the wrong reason
---
<p>
  I have seen <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">Jujutsu/jj</a>
  mentioned a few times over the months as an easier way to use Git.
  As a proficient Git user, I was not particularly interested.  Once
  you actually <em>get</em> Git, you can do just about anything.
  Sure, the Git CLI is rather... unergonomic, but there are
  alternative frontends like <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>.
  So I was not particularly interested in jj, as I didn't think it
  offered any value to me.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, I learned that jj was created by a Googler, potentially to
  be integrated with Google's own source control system.  Google is
  not flawless, but their engineers do tend to be relatively smart,
  and coincidentally I found myself with some free time, so I went and
  read all of jj's documentation, just to see if there was anything
  interesting about it.
</p>

<p>
  Oh boy, have I got something to tell you.  jj is very, very
  interesting, but not for the reasons I had heard.
</p>

  <h1>jj's features</h1>
  <p>
    jj is built on top of, and is functionally compatible with Git.
    This is both very cool and a very smart decision.  It means that you
    have very little reason <em>not</em> to try jj, because you can
    always switch back to Git, and you can collaborate with other people
    using Git transparently.  One could argue that this is the only way
    to design a VCS that has a hope of dethroning Git.  However, this is
    not the most interesting aspect of jj.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most common selling point for jj is that it's easier to learn
    and use than Git.  It's hard for me to judge, as neither a novice
    Git user nor a Git CLI user, but it does seem to me that jj's CLI is
    likely better than Git's, and it is likely easier for novice users
    to pick up than Git.  To be fair, that is a fairly low bar, and it
    is the least interesting aspect of jj.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another rather abrasive "feature" of jj is that it gets rid of the
    staging area and automatically commits everything into a working
    commit.  People seem to have strong opinions about this, but quite
    frankly, it is a rather superficial distinction, it can be turned
    off, and it's really just not that important.
  </p>

  <p>
    The next two features I have heard mentioned are a bit more
    interesting, but not, by themselves, revolutionary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first is that jj treats conflict as a first class concept, and
    lets you resolve them when you want, rather than forcing you to
    resolve them immediately when they happen.  This is rather nice, but
    I wouldn't consider it revolutionary, and while Git with rerere is
    inferior, by itself would not make me use jj over plain Git.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second is that jj lets you undo anything.  It is kind of like
    reflogs in Git, except it applies to all aspects of the repository.
    This is really useful for novices, but less so for proficient Git
    users, since you don't really get into situations where you would
    need this feature.  However, this leads us into what is the most
    interesting aspect of jj.
  </p>

  <p>
    Actually, let me mention a few other features first.  jj also
    natively supports worktrees (called workspaces in jj) and sparse
    checkouts.  I mention these not just to build some more suspense,
    but because all of the features mentioned so far, are basically
    happy little accidents.

  <h1>jj's design</h1>
  
  <p>
    You see, jj was designed around a single feature requirement.  That
    requirement led to a very simple design addition to Git's DVCS
    model, that naturally enabled all of the features:
  </p>

  <p>
    jj was designed to support concurrency.
  </p>

  <p>
    Around when Git was first released, what made it and other DVCSes so
    powerful is that multiple developers could create their own
    repository checkouts and work independently of one another.  They
    could work concurrently.
  </p>

  <p>
    But a single Git repository cannot be modified concurrently.  If you used
    Git a lot, you know that Git repositories have a lock file to serialize
    modifications.
  </p>

  <p>
    But what if?  What if you could put a Git repository into Dropbox or
    Google Drive, shared to a dozen developers, and have them all
    operate on it concurrently?  What if you didn't have to serialize
    requests to a Git server?
  </p>

  <p>
    What if, if version control is so good, we just put the repository
    state under version control?
  </p>

  <p>
    That's what Martin von Zweigbergk, the veritable mad lad behind jj,
    did.
  </p>

  <p>
    You take everything that comprises the repository state, all of the
    branches, refs, etc., and you shove that into a commit.  When you
    make any change, whether that be creating a new commit,
    adding/moving/deleting a ref, that creates a new commit.
  </p>

  <p>
    Boom, you get jj.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you want concurrency, you can't have weird intermediate states,
    like resolving conflicts during a rebase.  That's why jj has first
    class conflicts.
  </p>

  <p>
    What if two commands try to modify the repository concurrently?
    Well, since the repository state is version controlled, you just
    create two branching commits.  What if those changes conflict?  Well
    guess what?  You've got first class conflicts, so you can just resolve
    the conflict later.
  </p>

  <p>
    Undo?  Since the repository state is version controlled, you can
    revert repository changes like regular commits.
  </p>

  <p>
    Staging area?  It's inconvenient if we want concurrency, so it's
    simpler if we commit everything into a "working commit".
  </p>

  <p>
    Workspaces and sparse checkouts?  Since all you need to modify (or
    read) the repository is to reference one commit of the repository
    state (which doesn't have to be the latest state) and you don't need
    any locking, these become trivial.  You don't have the restriction
    that Git has, of only being able to check out a branch in one
    worktree.
  </p>

  <p>
    All of this is built on top of the foundations of Git.  jj stores
    your source code using Merkle trees and objects in a CAS store
    just like Git (<em>using</em> Git in most cases, although jj
    supports alternate backends), and it stores the repository state
    using the same Merkle trees and CAS store.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simply by designing for concurrency, jj has enabled many features
    with only a "small" design addition to Git and some extra processing
    logic sprinkled on top.  This is the kind of design achievement I
    can only hope to claim one day for myself.
  </p>

<section>
  <h1>Possibilities</h1>

  <p>
    Personally, what I'm excited for are the new workflows that jj
    could enable for me.  I have to deal with a lot of Git
    repositories, often multiple copies of the same repositories and
    different forks of related repositories (for example, I have
    private and public forks of my dotfiles).  What if I could just
    have a single jj repository?  Since jj supports concurrency and
    workspaces, I could just add all of my Git repositories to a
    single jj repository, create dozens of workspaces, and check out
    different commits in each one.  This lets me deduplicate identical
    checkouts without having to worry about the details of object
    sharing as with <code>git clone --shared</code> and easily
    cherrypick changes across "repositories".
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm also a sucker for the fact that you can branch and rebase the
    repository state history.  I don't know if there are any practical
    applications yet, but it makes the mischievous child in me cackle.
