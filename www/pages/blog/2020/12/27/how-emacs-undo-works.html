title: How Emacs Undo Works
---

<p>
  A while ago I spent some time carefully figuring out how Emacs undo
  works.  I decided to post this here; perhaps you might find it
  interesting.
</p>

<p>
  First, you should have a basic idea of how Emacs
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html">undo</a>
  works.  When you edit a file, changes are placed on a undo list.  When
  you undo, the state of the buffer is reverted according to the undo
  list; however the undo itself is placed on the undo list, so you redo
  by undoing again.  The advantage of this approach is that you will
  never lose any state your buffer was in, and all states are available
  via a linear undo (unlike undo-tree which requires navigating a
  non-linear tree).
</p>

<p>
  Unforunately, after many undos and undos of undos and undos of undos of
  undos, it's quite easy to get your undo history into an interesting
  mess, but once you understand exactly how it works, it's not so
  bad (keep reading).
</p>

<p>
  First, I will describe the rules governing undo.  Next, I will walk
  through an example of a complex undo change.  Finally, I will present
  the state of the undo list for completeness.
</p>

<p>
  If you read the manual, linked above, you will know that there are
  two undo commands, <code>undo</code>
  and <code>undo-only</code>.  <code>undo-only</code> will only undo,
  skipping undoing undos (redoing).
</p>

<p>
The rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>All changes, including undos, get added to the front of the undo
    chain.</li>
  <li><code>undo</code> moves back one state along the undo chain.</li>
  <li><code>undo-only</code> moves back one state along the temporal axis.</li>
  <li><code>undo-only</code> always move backward along the temporal axis.</li>
  <li><code>undo</code> moves in the opposite direction along the temporal axis as
    the change it is undoing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  I encourage you to follow along with the example.  Open up <code>*scratch*</code>
  and bind <code>undo-only</code> to an easy to press key; you don't want to use
  <code>M-x</code> for this.
</p>

<p>
First, insert some text
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o
</code></pre>

<p>
Each node represents a buffer state.  Each buffer state will be
labeled with a letter.  For convenience, type <code>a RET</code> to
move to state A.  The <code>RET</code> is an easy way to make Emacs
set a break in the undo chain; otherwise Emacs will group contiguous
inserts into one "state".  Also, this state A is actually two states,
the "inserted a" and "inserted RET" states.  In this example, each
undo will actually be two undos, one to undo the <code>RET</code> and
one to undo the letter.
</p>

<p>
After following the above, your buffer should look like this:
</p>

<pre><code>a
b
c
</code></pre>

<p>
Next, undo twice:
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            /
           o
</code></pre>

<p>
You are now back at state A.  Note how the undo chain is presented
here.  The undos have been added to the end of the undo chain,
however, the chain is now going backward temporally.  We type some
more:
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            / D  E
  Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
</code></pre>

<p>
Still simple.  We keep going:
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            / D  E
  Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               / F  G  H
     Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                      /
                     / I  J
           Insert!  o--o--o
</code></pre>

<p>
  It's getting complex now; we'll start calling <code>undo-only</code> now:
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            / D  E
  Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               / F  G  H
     Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                      /
                     / I  J
           Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                         /
                 F  G   /
                 o--o--o
</code></pre>

<p>
  Our first <code>undo-only</code> goes back one state to state I.  So far so good.
</p>

<p>
  Our second <code>undo-only</code> goes back one state to state G.  So far so good.
</p>

<p>
  Our third <code>undo-only</code> goes back three states to state F.  However, we
only went back only one state "temporally": we skipped all intervening
undo/redo pairs.
</p>

<p>
We keep going.
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            / D  E
  Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               / F  G  H
     Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                      /
                     / I  J
           Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                         /
              D  F  G   /
              o--o--o--o
             /
           A/
           o
</code></pre>

<p>
Now we're all the way back to state A.  With <code>undo</code>, we would have had
to traverse every single state (count them, there's a lot), but with
<code>undo-only</code>, it only took five.
</p>

<p>
Now for the final stretch.  We insert a few more fresh states:
</p>

<pre><code>           A  B  C
Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               /
              o
             /
            / D  E
  Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                /
               / F  G  H
     Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                      /
                     / I  J
           Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                         /
              D  F  G   /
              o--o--o--o
             /
           A/ K  L
  Insert!  o--o--o
</code></pre>

<p>
And we undo a whole bunch:
</p>

<pre><code>            A  B  C
 Insert! o--o--o--o  Undo!
                 /
                /
               o
              /
             / D  E
   Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                 /
                / F  G  H
      Insert!  o--o--o--o  Undo!
                       /
                      / I  J
            Insert!  o--o--o  undo-only
                          /
               D  F  G   /
               o--o--o--o
              /
            A/ K  L
   Insert!  o--o--o  Undo!
                 /
                /
               o
              /
             / D  F  G  I  J
(continue)  o--o--o--o--o--o
</code></pre>

<p>
Okay, what happened here?  We undid the new states we added, and those
undo actions get added going backward temporally.  After that though,
we started undoing undos.  These undo changes get added with the
reverse temporality as the original changes, so these undo changes are
going forward temporally.  If you did <code>undo-only</code> at this point, you
would undo these changes.
</p>

<p>
  (But wait, aren't these changes undo changes? <code>undo-only</code> doesn't undo
undos, right?  Well, these changes are actually undos of undos, so
they're actually redos, not undos, hence why they move forward
temporally.)
</p>

<p>
That's it for the example.  Keep in mind however that this "undo
chain" is just a concept to help understand how undo works.  What
Emacs actually stores is <code>buffer-undo-list</code>.  You can check it out
with <code>describe-variable</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you have been following along with the example, the state of
<code>buffer-undo-list</code> should be like below.  I have annotated it with
points from the undo chain diagrams.
