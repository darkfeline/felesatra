title: Last Command is Snake x Bullet Hell
---
<p>
  I have had the pleasure of playing through Last Command recently.
  Last Command is one of those games; it takes a simple premise, and
  it executes it supremely.
</p>

<p>
The game's description calls it "Snake x Bullet Hell", and that's
exactly what it is, and it works so well. You play as "Python" (it's a
double pun: python == snake and python == programming language) and
fight various bosses ("programs") by collecting "data" to make
yourself longer and then "spend" them to attack the boss. The basic
controls are just like Snake: you move in a direction
(up/down/left/right) and you keep moving until you change
direction. The game adds two abilities: dash and analyze. Dash is
self-explanatory: you can dash a short distance in any direction with
a short invincibility frame. Analyze lets you "suck" in your tail so
you're a dot and stop moving automatically, allowing you to more
easily navigate waves of bullets, while also slowing you down (i.e.,
"focus" for Touhou players). While in Analyze, you also gradually
consume your data/tail to attack the boss. Once you empty the boss's
HP gauge, you need to get close and Dash to deliver the final blow.
</p>

<p>
You can see how immediately, the game makes you engage with all of the
mechanics: you have to collect data to grow your tail and do
damage. You have to use Analyze to dodge bullets and attack. You have
to use Dodge to dodge bullets and finish the boss. This is Last
Command in a nutshell: all of the mechanics interact and provide that
divine game design experience where you're using all of your abilities
to engage with the game's challenges.
</p>

<p>
I could go on and on, but here's a few more examples: you get passive
skills to set in a limited number of slots to enhance your abilities
in various ways. These fall into broad categories, such as enhancing
dash or analyze, and setting skills in a set give you "set bonuses"
such as increasing the total amount of data you can collect at one
time and spawning extra data or decreasing how much data you need to
enter Overdrive. Overdrive is triggered when you collect enough data,
and it increases the speed and damage of your attacks when you
Analyze. The tradeoff is that it means you need to grow a longer tail,
and the tail makes you easier to get hit, and when you get hit, you
drop data. Risk vs reward. The passives you set can thus greatly
influence your playstyle. Do you want to dash through bullets and play
aggressively/reactively? Or do you methodically build up a long tail
and crush the boss in one attack?
</p>

<p>
You also get one slot for an active skill, which costs skill
points. You recover skill points by moving in snake mode, so you are
discouraged from "turtling" in Analyze to dodge bullets. Not to
mention, you won't able to dodge some bullet patterns with your slow
Analyze movement speed, and there are some mechanics that force you
out of Analyze (likewise, there are mechanics that force you into
Analyze or to not Dash).
</p>

<p>
The highlight of the game is the bosses, and they do not
disappoint. Every boss has unique, thematic gimmicks. True to bullet
hell custom, bosses have multiple stages that you have to beat, and
each stage is unique. Generally, the earlier stages each introduce
different gimmicks, and the later stages ramp up the gimmicks and/or
combine them. Some of the bosses might remind you of Undertale
(except, of course, with substantially more bullets to dodge). I don't
want to spoil too much, but let me just say, you should brush up on
your mental arithmetic, because you'll need to use it under pressure.
</p>

<p>
The music is great. All of the bosses have their own themes of course,
just like Touhou (in fact, one of the bosses seems distinctly inspired
by Touhou). Even
the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exquTo2hWX8&list=PLyr9a9FYNbkGMtIllm1K8-WWVu5ekEzqa&index=3">tutorial
one</a> is a banger.
</p>

<p>
Outside of the bosses, there are some minor "platforming" sections in
the overworld, which serves as a nice break between bosses. There's
also the story, which isn't going to win awards, but it is perfectly
fine. It's also somewhat prescient now, as it is set in a world where
"AI" programs have outlived their human masters.
</p>

<p>
The main game is fairly short, less than 10 hours, although that
depends entirely on how many times you need to retry the bosses, which
you will need to do a lot. Thankfully, the game offers four
difficulties, so even novices should be able to clear the game without
too much trouble. The difficulty setting not only changes how much
damage you do/take, but also some of the stage mechanics/bullet
patterns. I'd suggest starting on Expert and dropping the difficulty
when you get stuck. If you're itching for more after beating the main
game, there are also some extra challenge/boss rush modes.
</p>

<p>
This game deserves a lot more love; if any of the above interests you
at all, please pick it up and give it a try. Worst case you can refund
it if it's not for you if you pick it up on Steam; the game starts and
plays fast, so you'll have gotten plenty of content in two hours.
