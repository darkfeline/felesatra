  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>This is my homepage.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.</p>

  <p>Site will be undergoing a rewrite at some point in the future.</p>

  <p><s>Site is under construction, so expect it to change over time.  However, it
    will stay simple, as I'm not fond of loading 10 MB of JavaScript and CSS for
    a document that should by all rights be no more than 10 kB.</s></p>
