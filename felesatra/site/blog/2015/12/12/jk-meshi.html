  Short and simple is best.

<p>
  As each episode is three minutes long, *JK Meshi!* doesn't have to offer a whole
  lot to make those three minutes worth your time, but it does so anyway.

  It lampoons itself thusly:

        It's the "gourmet anime" with some middle-school girls who chat together and
        then make some food with a twist.  The one that's receiving encouraging words
        from anime fans like, "This isn't gourmet!"

        Yeah, that's the one.  It's ranked 60th out of the 60 anime shows that started
        airing this fall.  And, there are only three voice actors because it's a super
        low-cost production.  But it's interesting...  Probably.

  The show's animation and production values are poor, but each episode makes up
  for it with three full minutes worth of content.  The three girls chat about
  various topics, then each episode finishes by introducing a simple dish.

<p>
  There's nothing quite like enjoying a baked chocolate treat, made with a recipe
  introduced in the show, while listening to the following exchange:

        It's true that Naosuke ordered a crackdown on opposition, especially those
        against foreign trade in the Ansei Purge.  But if Japan didn't start opening up
        at that point in time, I don't think we'd live in the country we do now.

        The French Revolution happened in 1789, and the symbol of Japan's
        modernization, the Constitution, was signed in 1889.  We were a whole century
        slower than the great powers.  Naosuke led the way to try to close that gap!

        Wait, Reina, I can't agree with you.  You know that Naosuke's methods were
        dictatorial and oppressive.  I think the reason Japan is said to have such a
        weak democracy is directly related to Naosuke's methods.  Basically, in the
        French Revolution, people obtained freedom, equality, and philanthropy in a
        bottom-up revolution.  On the other hand, in Japan's case, the revolution was
        enforced top-down by rulers like Naosuke, so democracy never truly took root in
        the people.  You get me, Ryouka?
