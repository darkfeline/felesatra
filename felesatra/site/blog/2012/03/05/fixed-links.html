  Somehow ifile.it dropped all of my files.  Ever since the MegaUpload incident,
  it seems there are no good file sharing sites anymore.  Nice job inhibiting
  creativity, government!

  Until I find a better solution, I'm hosting all files directly on my server.
  I'll also be putting up torrent links so my server doesn't commit suicide.
  Please, please try the torrent links first.  This is my first time with
  torrents, so I'm not sure I set it up correctly, and I can't keep my computer
  on all the time, but I'll try to keep it on during the day, and if you torrent
  it, please keep it open to seed for others.  If anyone has any free file
  hosting suggestions or are willing to mirror, please e-mail me or leave a
  comment or something.
