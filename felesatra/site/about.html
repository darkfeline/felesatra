  <h1>About me</h1>

  <p>
    I like it when things are done the right way.  I do not like it when things
    are done the wrong way because that is the leading cause of every single
    thing gone wrong in society, both now and forever.
  </p>

  <p>My interests include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>single player video games</li>
    <li>anime</li>
    <li>music</li>
    <li>scripting/programming</li>
    <li>system administration/management</li>
    <li>hacking ("MacGyvering")</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some personal links:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{ abs_url('projects/') }}">my projects</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://gethub.com/darkfeline">my GitHub page</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>About this site</h1>

  <p>
    This is my personal website, and thus it hosts content that I feel like
    hosting.  For the most part, this is limited to my own blog posts and
    assorted pages that I have written and now maintain, but if you have any
    content that you would like me to host, feel free to contact me; I will host
    it if I like it.

    <h1>Design principles</h1>

    <p>
      This site may not look like what you're used to.  If so, that would because
      the sites you are familiar with follow questionable design principles.
      Here are the design principles for this site:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simple is best.</li>
      <li>Content is king.</li>
      <li>Pages should be HTML documents that are viewable without CSS or
        JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      To make a point, compare
      <a href="http://everyfuckingwebsite.com/">every fucking website</a> with
      <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">a motherfucking website</a>.

    <h1>SSL/TLS</h1>

    <p>
      This site's SSL certificate is signed by a private CA, owned by me.  The CA
      certificate can be found <a href="{{ abs_url('files/cert/ca.cert.pem') }}">here</a>, and
      the signature for the certificate, made with my public key is
      <a href="{{ abs_url('files/cert/ca.cert.pem.asc') }}">here</a>.  After verifying
      that the certificate is signed by me, you can add it to your browser as
      trusted.

  <h1>Contact</h1>

  <p>
    My public GPG key can be found on the
    {% call pgpkey() %}SKS keyservers{% endcall %}.
    You can contact me using one of the emails associated with that key.  Of
    course, I would prefer that you encrypt your emails using that key.
