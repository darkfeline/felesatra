Basically, I haven't had the time to do transcribing (or blogging =P),
simple as that.  I in fact have The World God Only Knows (that monster
of a piece) almost done, waiting to be revised and written up, but you
know how things go (or maybe you don't, you productivity god, you).  One
of these days, I promise.

One of these days.
