<p>Keihan is a constructed language from the Surge Concerto video game series
  made by GUST.  It is fairly complex; what follows are some of my notes on the
  language.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>

<p>A lot of information can be found in officially released materials and other
  pages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.genomirai.com/WorldSettingDocument/language/">
    Official Keihan generator
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.genomirai.com/WorldSettingDocument/index.php?%25E5%25A5%2591%25E7%25B5%2586%25E6%2583%25B3%25E7%2595%258C%25E8%25A9%25A9">
    Official Keihan World Setting page
  </a></li>
  <li><a href="http://artonelico.wikia.com/wiki/Emotional_Song_Pact">
    EXA_PICO page (English translation)
  </a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>Since there does not exist a detailed description of Keihan's writing system
  at this time, I have done some research and written one here.</p>

<p>Note that some of this information was derived experimentally and might be
  inaccurate.  Please send me any contradictions you find.</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>Keihan possesses a straightforward set of alphabet and punctuation
  characters.  Keihan may seem like a substitution of the Latin alphabet on the
  surface, but that illusion shall disappear shortly.</p>

<p>Here is the alphabet:</p>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/alphabet.jpg" alt="The Keihan alphabet, from A to Z." >}}

<p>There is no distinction between upper or lower case.</p>

<p>Here are the punctuation characters:</p>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/punctuation.jpg" alt="Keihan punctuation marks." >}}

<p>Ignore the leading <code>a</code> characters; they are there to force the official
  character generator to render the punctuation.</p>

<p>From left to right, they are <code>;</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>!</code>,
  and <code>=</code>.  The semicolon is Keihan's sentence terminator; it
  functions like a period.  The reason it is a semicolon may be related to the
  strong computer themes in Surge Concerto (this is obvious in the other
  language in the series, REON-4213).  The equal sign is used as a topic or
  subject marker.  The question mark and exclamation mark function like they do
  in English.</p>

<p>Keihan's numeric system is hexadecimal (again showing the computer theme):</p>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/numbers.jpg" alt="Keihan digits, from 0 to F and including the decimal point." >}}

<h3>Clusters</h3>

<p>While the characters shown above are used for loanwords, they are never used
  alone in Keihan itself.  Instead, they are combined into clusters consisting
  of two, three, or four characters each.</p>

<h4>Forms</h4>

<p>Clusters come in seven different forms.</p>

<p>Clusters of two characters (2-clusters) have two possible forms.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Form A</dt>
  <dd>First at right, second at left.</dd>

  <dt>Form B</dt>
  <dd>First at bottom, second at top.</dd>
</dl>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/2-cluster.jpg" alt="Keihan cluster forms A and B." >}}

<p>Clusters of three characters (3-clusters) have three possible forms.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Form C</dt>
  <dd>First at top right, second at bottom right, third at left</dd>

  <dt>Form D</dt>
  <dd>First at bottom right, second at bottom left, third at top</dd>

  <dt>Form E</dt>
  <dd>First at bottom, second at middle, third at top</dd>
</dl>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/3-cluster.jpg" alt="Keihan cluster forms C, D, and E." >}}

Clusters of four characters (4-clusters) have two possible forms.

<dl>
  <dt>Form F</dt>
  <dd>First at bottom right, second at bottom middle, third at bottom left, forth at top</dd>

  <dt>Form G</dt>
  <dd>First at bottom, second at middle right, third at middle left, fourth at top</dd>
</dl>

{{< fig src="img/keihan/4-cluster.jpg" alt="Keihan cluster forms F and G." >}}

<h4>Rules</h4>

<p>The rules for forming clusters is fairly complex.  Using the table below,
  find the letter in the cluster with the highest priority and use the form
  indicated by that letter.</p>

<p>These rules were determined experimentally from the official Keihan generator,
  so they might be incorrect or sub-optimal.</p>

<p>(Table can be sorted with Javascript; try clicking on the the headers.)</p>

<h4>Mutations</h4>

<p>In addition to forming clusters, each letter in Keihan also mutates according
  to its position in a cluster.</p>

<p>There are nine different mutations.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Pure</dt>
  <dd>Base form of character when not in a cluster.</dd>

  <dt>Vertical-0</dt>
  <dd>Used for the right character in form A.</dd>

  <dt>Horizontal-0</dt>
  <dd>Used for the bottom character in form B.</dd>

  <dt>Vertical-1</dt>
  <dd>Used for the left character in forms A and C.</dd>

  <dt>Horizontal-1</dt>
  <dd>Used for the top character in forms B, D, and F, and for the horizontal
    characters in forms E and G.</dd>

  <dt>Horizontal-2</dt>
  <dd>Used for the right characters in form C.</dd>

  <dt>Vertical-2</dt>
  <dd>Used for the bottom characters in form D.</dd>

  <dt>Vertical-3</dt>
  <dd>Used for the bottom characters in form F.</dd>

  <dt>Horizontal-3</dt>
  <dd>Used for the middle characters in form G.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here are all of the mutations for all letters:</p>

<h2>Corrections</h2>

<p>Please send me any corrections: <a

<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The official Keihan generator seems to make the first cluster of each line
    smaller.  I'm not sure if this is intentional or not.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changelog</h2>

<h3>v1.1 2015-06-09</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Removed Appendix because it was poorly written.</li>
  <li>Removed alternate clustering rules because maintaining two sets of rules
    takes extra work.</li>
  <li>Added rule generation algorithm, so now clustering rules are generated
    using gathered data.  This should make things go more smoothly.</li>
  <li>Fixed clustering rules using observation by aquagon. Added sorting
    functionality to rules table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>v1.0 2015-05-28</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Finished info on mutations.</li>
  <li>Typo correction by aquagon.</li>
</ul>
