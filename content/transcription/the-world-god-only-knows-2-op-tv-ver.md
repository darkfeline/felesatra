This song, for me, was like a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster.  I felt like
I had what precious little musical talent I have ripped out of me and
repeatedly and ruthlessly beaten.  I know the piece ends in E minor, but
beyond that, I can only guess at what keys the two melodies are
traipsing through.

Although, I have to say that working so intimately with a song such as
this really allows me to appreciate how intricately the lyrics of both
voices are aligned, especially when the two voices intersect. Also, it's
very aurally pleasing when the song transitions from a solo to a duet
and back.  Not so much the ears dribbling out of the brain after an
hours-long transcribing session, though (or something like that).
