## About me

I like doing things the right way.  By extension, I like things that are
interesting, such as a well-written story, or innovative, such as the
advancement of science and technology

I hate doing things the wrong way.  By extension, I hate bullshit, which
includes things like legalized bribery (lobbying and campaign donations) and
"unlimited" data plans with caps and throttling.

My interests include:

- single player video games
- anime
- music
- scripting/programming
- system administration/management
- hacking ("MacGyvering")

Some personal links:

- [my projects]({{< ref "pages/projects.md" >}})
- [my Github page][Github]
