I dragged the TV size OP transcription I did (chapter three of the song)
and added the first chapter of the full version (Yes, this song is
divided into chapters; it's that long).  So far, both are incomplete,
but workable.

## Updates

### 2012-03-04 v0.3

Since my links were taken down, I'm uploading the version I have right
now, which is almost done.

### 2011-02-06 v0.2

I finished Chapter One and fixed up Chapter Three; you'll notice that the
lyrics for Chapter Three are a bit different; credit for the lyrics go to
ThreeLeafIvy and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBgRDMyXzw">his
video</a>.  I also reorganized the voicing/staffing so it's more clear overall,
although it means harmony voices will have abundant amounts of rests.  There
also a harmony line for Chapter Three that wasn't present in the TV size
version, which is why there's a harmony line full of rests that cuts off at
measure 56.

### 2010-11-23 v0.1

I considered finishing this before posting, but given that this song is so damn
long (eight minutes), with multiple voices, it'd probably be awhile before I can
finish the transcription.
