Yeah, sorry about that.  This and that, y'know.  I'm on my last week of
break, and I aim to transcribe as many songs as possible and post them
here.  Here's the first of the bunch, which I transcribe half of a
couple of months ago.  I know I promised Daydream Syndrome (I have half
of it lying around somewhere), and I need to finish God only knows five
minutes of awesomeness piece, sooner or later.  Ah well.  Here ya go.
