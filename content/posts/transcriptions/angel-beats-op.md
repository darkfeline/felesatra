Here's a little something to show that I'm not dead because I'm in fact
not dead, I hope.  I'm right at the end of the school year, so I won't
be updatng for a while, although I do have God Only Knows almost done
(the whole five chapters).

Oh right, I remember what I wanted to say.  Forget the torrent links.  I
don't have the time to make them work or to make sure that they work,
and hopefully my server can handle the load.
