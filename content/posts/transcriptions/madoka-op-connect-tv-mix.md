The key changes threw me off, and I kept needing to change the key
signature as I transcribed.  It would've been easier had I (if I was
able to) transcribed the chords as well, but...

The winter season has so many series with good songs, like Yumekui
Merry (夢喰いメリー) and Gosick (ゴシック); I'll probably take on those
as well.
