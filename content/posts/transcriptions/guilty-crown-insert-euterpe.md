The last one!  I've added dynamic marks and breath marks because they're
really noticeable in a song like this one, especially when the voice
part has solo.  I stopped transcribing the harmony at the point where
the synth voice enters as I banged my head on the wall trying to figure
out hwo I might split out all the voices.  For a piano arrangement, I
think you can just bang out arpeggiated chords in the right key that
match each measure and you should be fine.  If you want to play the song
as is on the piano... Good luck.
