Here's one more in the same day.  This anime series is not very well
known and needs more love.  It's a fun bright series and very
heartwarming (as its title can tell you), and it has a fun little OP, in
C Major no less!  Seriously, whatever bland harem/slice of
life/shounen/fantasy series you're watching is <em>probably</em> not
worth enough to justify not dropping it and watching this (and then
downloading my transcription and leaving a thank you). No, I wasn't
watching old anime when I had free time to transcribe songs...
