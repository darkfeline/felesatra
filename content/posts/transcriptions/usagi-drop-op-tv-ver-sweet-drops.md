Yo! I haven't done anything in a while, but here's the first of the
Summer 2011 batch.  I must say there's a lot of good anime this season;
I'm looking forward to it!

Maybe it's because I haven't touched the piano in a while, but I had a
bit of trouble with some of the rhythms/pitches in this one.  I'm not
too sure about the triplets vs. the
dotted-eighth-dotted-eighth-eighth-note rhythms; are they the former or
the latter or the former, but played expressively so they sound like the
latter?

Bunny Drop is about a single man who decides to take care of his late
grandfather's illegitimate daughter.  Bunny Drop deals with serious and
mature subjects, yet it presents itself as a children's story through
the character of Rin, its art style, and its theme songs.  Sweet Drops
is a cute song accompanied by a cute PV that balances Bunny Drop's story
about a girl struggling with her father's death and society's perception
of her and a man who decides to take on the burden of raising a child on
his own.
