About a month or so ago I moved my blog from Jekyll to Pelican.  The motivation,
I believe, was that Jekyll lacked pagination.  That Pelican is written in Python
as opposed to Ruby is but a bonus.  Ultimately, both are static site generators
and the plain text format makes migrations largely a matter of writing short
scripts to convert between formats.
