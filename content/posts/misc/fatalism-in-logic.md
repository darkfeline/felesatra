title: Fatalism in logic

One of the thorny areas of logic which, to the best of my knowledge, is
completely undeveloped is the concept of causation.  Due to fairly recent
advances in predicate logic, we now have a wide range of logical forms for
expressing many concepts, as well as tools for logical manipulations, proofs,
and so on.  But thus far, there isn't any clear way to work with causation, and
there's a pretty clear logical reason for that: causation doesn't exist.

That's a pretty extreme claim which demands proof, and I will do my best to lay
out a convincing argument.  Ultimately, causation is the same as morality or
aesthetics.  Ask someone if they know what causation is and they say yes, but
ask them to define it and they falter.

Let's consider an example of this so-called causation.  I push on a glass of
water and the glass is knocked over.  Common sense dictates that my pushing on
the glass caused the glass to be knocked over.  I yawn as I push on the glass.
Does my yawn cause the glass to be knocked over?  Does my yawn cause me to push
on the glass?  I yawn and push on the glass.  My yawn causes me to push my hand
forward, and pushing my hand forward causes the glass to be knocked over.  My
yawn causes the glass to be knocked over (common sense is quite handy here).

I have a light breakfast in the morning.  Does having a light breakfast cause me
to yawn?  Does having a light breakfast cause the glass to be knocked over?
Following this to its conclusion, we find that the Big Bang caused the glass of
water to be knocked over.  So everything that happens before the glass of water
was knocked over caused the glass to be knocked over.

But there really isn't any reason to limit ourselves to events before the glass
was knocked over.  Time flows just as well backward as forward; the laws of
physics that govern the behavior of everything in this universe work perfectly
in either direction.  We examine our universe with all of the physical laws
reversed, and we can deduce similarly that everything after the glass of water
was knocked over caused the glass to be knocked over.  We can then repeat this
for every event that ever happened and conclude that every event each causes
every other event, at which point causation because rather meaningless as
a concept.

Going further, there really isn't any reason for us to treat time specially; we
can just reduce time to another dimension and represent the entire timeline of
our universe as a single collection of 4-dimensional objects, at which point
causation utterly disappears.  The universe becomes analogous to a book, where
everything that happens in the book's story simply exists.  We can read parts of
it in sequence, just as we experience all of the states of reality in sequence,
and perceive the illusions of the passage of time and causality, but my pushing
on the glass causes the glass to tip over just as much as the words "Bob let go
of the ball" on the paper causes the existence of the words "The ball hit the
floor" somewhere else on the paper.

Logical implication ("if A then B") is sometimes mistaken for causation, simply
because causation is the mistaken form of logical implication.  "If Bob is
a human, then Bob is an animal", but clearly Bob being a human doesn't cause Bob
to be an animal, it is merely a rule that describes the world.  Likewise, "if
I push on this glass then the glass is knocked over", and my pushing on the
glass does not cause the glass to be knocked over, merely that the laws of
physics dictate that one follows from the other.  Causation doesn't exist.
Thus, it follows logically that there is no way to express causation in formal
logic.

Put another way, causation is a concept humans evolved to help make sense of
logical implication in temporal sequence to better survive and reproduce.

So, causation is still a useful tool, just like morality, and if
fatalism seems like a horrible idea, well, don't sweat the small stuff.
