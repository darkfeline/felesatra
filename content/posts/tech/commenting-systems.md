title: Commenting systems

After migrating from Wordpress to Jekyll, the one feature that was
fundamentally lacking is the lack of a commenting system.  It is
impossible to add dynamic content directly into the static content of
Jekyll; you would need to add either JavaScript or server-side scripting
like PHP.  Either way, additional complexity is unavoidable.

The most common solution seems to be relying on Disqus to outsource all
commenting functionality and data.  Disqus is simple to install and
maintain, but I am loath to use it because I disagree with giving one's
data to a commercial third party in principle, whether or not Disqus
uses that data improperly.  I have no qualms with the design of Disqus
itself; I would use it if there were an open-source equivalent that was
easy to self-host.

There are other alternatives that are open source, with varying degrees
of complexity, but ultimately, I decided to not include a commenting
system for now.

For what use is a commenting system?  A commenting system allows readers
to discuss articles on the site.  However, I feel that this is not the
right way of doing discussion.  The right way is to hold the discussion
with the community of your choice, by linking the article on Reddit,
Facebook, Twitter, IRC, or your preferred forum.  This way, people who
evangelize one side can do so peacefully in one place, people who
evangelize the other in other, and people who are looking for an open
discussion somewhere else.  I do not see a compelling reason to include
a commenting system on the article itself, unless the site has grown big
enough to sustain its own community, of course (although I find that
such communities tend to devolve into cesspits: see
YouTube comments, for example).

There is one other use for a commenting system: contacting the author of
the article or adding additional relevant information or corrections to
the article.  Both can be done better by emailing the author than
a commenting system.

Thus, I will be sticking to the tried and true "contact the author or
maintainer" model for my blog.  It is, in my opinion, The Right Thing.
