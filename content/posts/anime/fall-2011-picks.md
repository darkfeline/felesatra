Another anime season; too many shows, not enough time?  Don't worry,
most of them are rehashes of the same show over and over again.
Thankfully, there are a good handful of shows that are truly interesting
and definitely worth watching; in fact, this is probably the most
original season for a good while now.

<ul>
<li>Mawaru Penguindrum (continuing from last season)</li>
<li>Guilty Crown</li>
<li>Kimi to Boku.</li>
<li>UN-GO</li>
<li>Last Exile:Ginyoku no Fam</li>
</ul>
