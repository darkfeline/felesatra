<i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> is a very old animated movie set during World War
II about a boy and her sister struggling to survive.  Despite its obscurity at
the time of its release, it has since gained more well-deserved recognition from
a wider audience.

Because of its history, <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> already has a lot of
written reviews and summaries, so I won't bother with either; you can read Roger
Ebert's <a
href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000319/REVIEWS08/3190301/1023">here</a>.
As I understand it, Roger Ebert is a renowned film critic; however, I strongly
believe that his interpretation of this movie is incorrect.  Perhaps he was
deluded by <a
href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wabi-sabi">that strange
feeling that is invoked by many Japanese works</a>, perhaps his search for that
perfect movie left him desperate, I can only guess.  Ebert calls <i>Grave of the
Fireflies</i> a war film.  It is not a war film; rather, it is a film about the
tragedy that befell two siblings who, forced to grow up too quickly, isolated
themselves from society.

His mistake is understandable because the first twenty minutes or so
<i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> certainly portrays itself as a war film
might: we see the devastation caused by the Japan firebombings, leaving
the protagonist homeless and motherless.  We see people running in panic
and dead bodies everywhere.  We see Seito and Setsuko's town burnt to
the ground.  However, this fa√ßade is shattered by one specific event:
when Seito asks for more food, his aunt refuses, criticizing Seito for
not contributing to society.  Due to his immaturity, he doesn't work,
and due to his pride, he refuses to apologize to his aunt, who might
still have taken pity on him and his sister.  Seito moves out and leads
a solitary life with his sister, depending only on thievery and
resourcefulness, and the tragedy that follows can only be attributed to
Seito's failure, not the war.  Had the film shown Seito trying
unsuccessfully to find a job, the film might have taken on a different
bent, but it did not because that was never the intention of its makers.
A war film would highlight the suffering caused by war, but from this
point on, <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> is a classic tragedy,
highlighting how Seito's immaturity leads to his and his sister's
deaths.

From Wikipedia:

> However, director Isao Takahata repeatedly denied that the film was an
anti-war anime. In his own words, "[the film] is not at all an anti-war
anime and contains absolutely no such message". Instead, Takahata had
intended to convey an image of the brother and sister living a failed
life due to isolation from the society and invoke sympathy particularly
in people in their teens and twenties.

Before digging into any work of art, it's always a good idea to look
into its history as well.  This applies mainly to literature, but also
to film, music, and video games.  <i>Grave of the Fireflies</i> is an
adaptation of an autobiographical novel by the same name.  Akiyuki
Nosaka, the author of that novel, intended for it to be an apology to
her sister, who died of malnutrition during wartime 1945. Neither the
book nor the film was ever intended to be about the war, merely about a
tragic, yet almost unnoticeable death occurring in the war's midst.  In
the titular scene where Setsuka makes a grave for the fireflies Seito
caught, war has no place.  There's only two siblings, isolated from
society, mourning the fragility of life.
