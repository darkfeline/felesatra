It's the beginning of a new anime season!  It's hard (and unfair) to
judge an anime without watching at the very least half, if not the
entire series, but unfortunately, time is precious and limited.  Here
are some series which are shaping up to be more than your standard
fanservice and plot series.  (I'm not saying of course that other series
aren't worth watching, but that they're most likely nothing that'll drop
your jaw (Yes, making you drop your jaw is about the standard I hold
anime up to; yes it is a bit high)).

<ul>
<li>Ano Natsu de Matteru</li>
<li>Another</li>
<li>Nisemonogatari</li>
<li>Last Exile: Ginyoku no Fam (continued)</li>
<li>Guilty Crown (continued)</li>
<li>Mirai Nikki (continued)</li>
<li>Mouretsu Uchuu Kaizoku (Bodacious Space Pirates)</li>
<li>Rinne no Lagrange</li>
</ul>

I'm sure some of these will turn out to be not as good, and some series
not listed here will turn out to be amazing.  I'll do a final round-up
at the end of the season and see how my predictions went!
